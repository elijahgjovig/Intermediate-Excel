## Sales Data Pivot Tables
Pivot tables to analyze a 450 row Sales Data Sheet. Quickly summarizes Sales for each month and product category. Grouped the months by quarter accordingly.
The second pivot table I added Interactive slicers for the Sum of Sales pivot table where you can filter the monthly sales by year, region, and product category.

## Data Model, Power Pivot, and KPI's
Created a Data model between two spreadsheets, Customer Info and Order Info. In the Data Model the variable I created a relationship with is the Customer ID in order to analyze the behavior of the customer and how many orders they are making. Created KPI to analyze the cost of freight in order to keep the costs of orders down. Found that our average cost of freight is higher than the ideal range for the cost of freight.

## Database Functions
Under the List Functions tab I used Database functions to analyze and summarize total sales, Division, and product category. Used the subtotal function at the top to create the sum. Included list Data Validation Where it says "Rent" under the Category.
